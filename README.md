# Abstract:
Maintenance of cellular function requires highly coordinated communication between trillions of biomolecules. However, over time, communication deteriorates, thereby disrupting effective information flow and compromising cellular health. To quantify the age-related loss of molecular communication, we applied information theory to quantify communication efficiency between transcription factors (TF) and corresponding target genes (TGs). Using single cell RNA-seq data from the limb muscle of young, middle-aged, and aged mice, we found that the precision with which TFs regulate TGs diminished with age, but that information transfer was preferentially preserved in a subset of gene pairs associated with homeostasis—a phenomenon we termed “age-based canalization”. Collectively, these data suggest that aging may be accompanied by a reallocation of resources that favor messages crucial to maintenance of stability and survival.

# Structure:
Figure 1: Useful information transmitted in transcriptional regulatory network declines with age as shown by decreasing mutual information

Figure 2: Loss of information with aging is driven by a decreased channel capacity

Figure 3: Certain gene pairs preserve useful information while others remain relatively constant.

Figure 4: Preserved genes are associated with homeostatic functions whereas compromised genes are associated with tissue adaptation.
