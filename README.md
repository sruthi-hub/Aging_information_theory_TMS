Goal is to understand how communication changes with aging from transcriptional regulatory network in Tabula Muris Senis : Aging single-cell RNA seq data

# Structure:
Figure 1: Communication declines with age at teh single-cell level 
Figure 2: Some biological functions are preserved with gaing
Figure 3: How and why does this preservation happen?
Figure 4: Validation of conclusion across tissues

For Nature Physics Journal:
The main text (excluding abstract, Methods, references and figure legends) is 2,000-3,000 words. Articles have 4-6 display items (figures and/or tables). As a guideline, Articles allow up to 50 references (excluding those cited exclusively in Methods).

The maximum title length is 15 words. The abstract is typically 150 words and is unreferenced; it contains a brief account of the background and rationale of the work, followed by a statement of the main conclusions introduced by the phrase "Here we show" or some equivalent. An introduction (without heading) of up to 500 words of referenced text expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the summary is acceptable), followed by a concise, focused account of the findings, ending with one or two short paragraphs of discussion.

Articles are peer reviewed, include received/accepted dates and may be accompanied by supplementary information.
